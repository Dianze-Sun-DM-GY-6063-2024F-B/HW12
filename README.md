Functionality
The potentiometer needs to be rotated to the far right (maximum value) as a prerequisite for unlocking.
The user must press both buttons simultaneously to light up the success indicator (LED 1).
If the user does not press both buttons simultaneously but presses only one, the system indicates a failure state by lighting up the failure indicator (LED 2).
If the potentiometer is not rotated to the far right, the system keeps both LEDs off regardless of the button inputs, avoiding potential confusion.
Design Logic
Potentiometer Detection:

The potentiometer serves as the initial condition to limit the systemâ€™s operational state. Using analogRead(), the potentiometer value is checked to determine if it reaches a certain threshold (e.g., >1000). If the condition is not met, the system ignores button inputs and keeps the LEDs off.
Button Input Detection:

The two buttons are the core of user interaction, each connected to a digital input pin. The digitalRead() function detects their states:
If both buttons are pressed simultaneously, the system recognizes the input as correct and lights up the success indicator (LED 1).
If only one button is pressed, the system interprets the input as incorrect and lights up the failure indicator (LED 2).
Feedback Mechanism:

When successful, LED 1 is lit, and LED 2 is turned off, indicating correct operation.
When a failure occurs, LED 2 is lit, and LED 1 is turned off, providing clear error feedback.
If the potentiometer does not meet the required condition, both LEDs remain off, signaling that the system is not ready to accept input.
